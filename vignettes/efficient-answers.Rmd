### R Version

#### 1. What version of R are you using? Is it the most up-to-date?

Your R version is stored in a variable called `R.Version`. Enter these commands to find out the version.

```{r}
R.version
R.version.string
```

This can be compared with the latest version, which is described on R's website: [cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). If you've not got the latest version, consider installing the latest version!



#### 2. Do any of your packages need updating?

To find out which (if any) of your packages need updating use the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
old.packages()
```
